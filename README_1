This is a testing project
It will help me to understand how to create README file and attach it to github and also to understand how github works
There is no need for users to get started with the project or get help - this is primary for testing purposes
Have made changes here and want to see how they are displayed
The extract from sample work:
The Product X feature is aimed to collect and display computer metrics (CPU utilization,
memory and disk usage) to further analyze and assess computer system performance
How and when the feature can be used
● when system monitoring is needed (including servers and infrastructure)
● to optimize resource allocation
● to plan capacity (for hardware upgrade or scaling infrastructure)
● for system diagnostics (after slowdowns or failures happened)
● for security monitoring (unusual CPU can be a sign of security issues)
● for cost management
● to measure the amount of apps used, their performance and user experience
The outcome: maintain system performance, optimize resource allocation, identify files and
directories that hold a significant amount of space and can be cleaned or archived.
September 19 - continue learnin about how the system works
Have an interview today, so i ll have to be prepared
